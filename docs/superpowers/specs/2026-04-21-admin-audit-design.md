# Admin Panel Deep Audit — Design Spec

**Status:** Spec approved (user, 2026-04-21). Next: writing-plans.
**Branch:** `phase-6-admin-audit` (separated from `phase-6-release-pipeline` ceremonially closed at main `b774b96`).
**Phase ref:** Phase 6 Item 7 (audit-only; fixes = Phase 6 Item 8; real-time sync = Phase 6 Item 9).

## Context

Admin panel (`https://admin.auracore.pro`) has accumulated issues over a 9-month build. Known pain points:

- **Bug 2 — Grant Subscription tier sync:** admin grants Pro tier via Subscriptions tab, DB row updates correctly, but Users tab still shows FREE. Root cause hypothesis (confirmed by 6.6 spec code read): `AdminSubscriptionController.Grant` only writes `Licenses.Tier`; Users list reads `Users.Tier`. Dual-source-of-truth.
- **Bug 3 — Refresh data-loss (NEW, cross-tab):** clicking any "Refresh" button across any tab clears all data panel-wide and data does not come back. Likely state/auth invalidation — Refresh forces hard page reload, in-memory JWT + api client reset, session state loss.
- **Rollback artifact risk:** user recalls breaking admin panel while adding security (Nginx basic auth), then rolled back to an older version. Unknown whether features present in source compile-time still function at runtime, or whether the rollback left deployment drift.
- **Mobile access required:** admin panel must be usable from a phone (current responsiveness unknown).
- **Updates tab:** shipped in Phase 6.6.E (commit `1eb42d8`) — new, worth an audit pass but scope should exclude re-spec'ing the design.

## Scope

### In scope — deep audit of 12 tabs

| Group | Tabs |
|---|---|
| MANAGEMENT | Users, Payments, Subscriptions, Licenses, Updates *(Phase 6.6.E)*, Devices |
| ANALYTICS | Crash Reports, Telemetry, Audit Log |
| SYSTEM | IP Whitelist, Configuration, Security *(QR-code 2FA only)* |

### Out of scope — intentionally deferred

- **Bug fixes** — this spec is audit-only. Every finding goes into `docs/admin-audit/findings/{tab}.md`. Batch fix phase is a separate Phase 6 Item 8.
- **Real-time sync infrastructure** (SignalR / SSE / polling) — Phase 6 Item 9, after fix phase.
- **Admin panel rewrite / migration to different framework** — if audit concludes the codebase is beyond saving, that's a user-escalation moment, not in-scope for this audit.
- **Creating new features** — audit maps current state; feature expansion is separate work.
- **Backend API hardening beyond bugs audit surfaces** — audit flags security issues it sees; full pen test is separate.

## Depth of audit (6-axis checklist applied per tab)

Every per-tab audit must cover these six axes explicitly. A section per axis in the findings file; if an axis has zero findings for a tab, mark as `"No findings"`.

### 1. Functional
- List view: search, pagination, sort, filter — each works?
- Create action: form validation, submit path, success state, DB write confirmation
- Update action: form pre-fills, submit path, UI reflects new state without manual refresh
- Delete action: confirmation dialog, DB delete, UI removes row
- Empty state: what renders when list is empty?

### 2. Code + DB sync
- Compare UI-displayed data to actual DB state (psql read-only query)
- After a mutation, does UI re-fetch (invalidate cache) or does it mutate local state optimistically?
- If optimistic: what happens on API error — rollback or stuck?
- Cross-tab impact: if Tab X mutates, does Tab Y reflect when visited?
- Bug 2 style dual-source-of-truth scan: any field rendered from A but updated via B?

### 3. Security
- Every backend endpoint under this tab has `[Authorize(Roles = "admin")]`?
- IDOR: parameters that could be mutated to access other records (tab-specific; single-tenant app so mainly moot, but verify)
- CSRF: mutation endpoints protected (ASP.NET Core antiforgery or stateless JWT-only — document which)
- XSS: user-provided content rendered with React's default escaping? any `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in this tab?
- SQL injection: any raw SQL in the admin controller? EF parameterized-only?
- Rate limit: mutation endpoints (grant subscription, delete user, ban IP) rate-limited?
- Audit log: admin actions logged with actor + timestamp + before/after state?
- Nginx basic auth bypass: does the tab's API endpoint require basic auth at Nginx layer? What happens with direct `curl` hitting `api.auracore.pro/api/admin/...` without basic auth (it passes because API is on a different vhost — verify)?

### 4. UX
- Loading indicator while data fetches?
- Error state: network error, server error, permission denied — each handled?
- Empty state: friendly message or broken rendering?
- Destructive action confirmation: "Are you sure?" on delete / revoke / ban?
- Toast/inline feedback on success/failure?
- Bug 3 (Refresh data-loss): does this tab survive a manual browser refresh?

### 5. Mobile responsiveness
- Viewport breakpoints to test: 320 (iPhone SE), 375 (iPhone 14 mini), 414 (iPhone 14 Pro Max), 768 (iPad portrait), 1024 (iPad landscape)
- Table reflow: does it horizontal-scroll gracefully or overflow the viewport?
- Tap target size: all interactive elements ≥ 44×44px?
- Modal/form fits in small viewport?
- Sidebar collapses to hamburger below some breakpoint?

### 6. Deployment drift
- Compare `/root/admin-panel/src/app/page.tsx` (source) to `/var/www/admin-panel/index.html` + `_next/static/chunks/*.js` (deployed) — any behavior visible in source but not in live production?
- Any UI elements rendered in live admin panel that don't exist in source (stale deploy)?
- Any features shipped in recent commits but not observable in live UI?
- User recalls breaking admin panel and rolling back — any commits reverted in source that should be?

## Tab audit order (pain-first)

1. **Subscriptions** — primary pain point (Bug 2 tier sync)
2. **Users** — tightly coupled to Subscriptions (tier display consumer)
3. **Licenses** — tier stack foundation (the actual source-of-truth data)
4. **Payments** — financial stack, Stripe + crypto flows, audit carefully
5. **Devices** — device registration + revoke
6. **Updates** — shipped Phase 6.6.E, light audit pass (bugs not design)
7. **Crash Reports** — read-heavy tab, lower priority
8. **Telemetry** — dashboard-style, lower mutation surface
9. **Audit Log** — read-only, verify tab behaves and has useful filter
10. **IP Whitelist** — mutation tab; CRUD + validation focus
11. **Configuration** — feature flags + maintenance mode + environment toggles
12. **Security** — narrow scope: QR-code 2FA activation only

## Deliverables

### Main spec + findings index

`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-21-admin-audit-design.md` — THIS file (methodology, scope, tab order, baseline known bugs). Updated as audit progresses with a master findings matrix.

### Per-tab findings files

`docs/admin-audit/findings/{tab-slug}.md` — 12 files, one per tab. Each uses this template:

```markdown
# {Tab} Audit Findings

**Tab:** {Tab name}
**Audit date:** 2026-04-NN
**Auditor:** subagent-{id}
**Source files audited:**
- Frontend: `/root/admin-panel/src/app/page.tsx` L{nn}-L{nn}
- API client: `/root/admin-panel/src/lib/api.ts` L{nn}-L{nn}
- Backend: `src/Backend/AuraCore.API/Controllers/Admin/Admin{Tab}Controller.cs`
- DB entity: `src/Backend/AuraCore.API.Domain/Entities/{Entity}.cs`
**Live test URL:** `https://admin.auracore.pro/{path}`
**Time spent:** N hours

## Summary

- N critical findings
- N high findings
- N medium findings
- N low findings
- Axes covered: functional, code+DB sync, security, UX, mobile, drift

## Findings

### F-1 [SEVERITY] Short title

**Axis:** functional | code-db-sync | security | ux | mobile | drift
**Symptom:** what user experiences
**Reproduction steps:**
1. ...
2. ...
3. Observe: ...

**Expected:** ...
**Actual:** ...

**Root cause:** file:line explanation (e.g., `AdminSubscriptionController.cs:47 — UPDATE writes only Licenses table, misses Users.Tier`)

**DB state (if DB involved):**
```sql
-- Verification query (read-only)
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'baconungabunga@gmail.com';
```
- Actual: `Tier = 'free'`
- Expected: `Tier = 'pro'` (matches licenses row)

**Fix suggestion:** (concrete approach, not implementation — that's fix phase's job)
- Option A: Denormalize — Grant endpoint writes both rows
- Option B: Single source of truth — drop Users.Tier column, always join Licenses

**Risk if unfixed:**
- User-facing: admin cannot tell who is actually Pro vs Free
- Revenue: Pro features may unlock for Free users or vice versa
- Support: repeated "I paid but it says Free" tickets
```

### Severity rubric

| Level | Criteria | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Critical** | Data loss, auth bypass, payment bug, breaks core admin workflow | Bug 3 refresh data-loss, auth missing on mutation endpoint |
| **High** | Feature broken, data displayed wrong, sync gap | Bug 2 tier sync, delete button no-op |
| **Medium** | UX pain, missing validation, error-handling gap | No confirmation on destructive action, silent API failure |
| **Low** | Code smell, hardcoded string, cosmetic | Magic number, unreachable branch |

## Execution strategy

**Sequential, exhaustive.** User explicitly chose slow+thorough over fast+parallel ("en küçük bir hata/bug ve ya security zafiyetini dahi bulmamız gerek, yavaş olması sorun değil").

- One subagent per tab (12 total subagents across this phase)
- Each subagent reads:
  - THIS spec (methodology + severity rubric)
  - Master findings matrix in this spec (for cross-tab patterns discovered by prior subagents)
  - Prior tab finding files (to learn cross-tab patterns like dual-source-of-truth)
- Model: **Sonnet** (deep code read + security judgment + DB reasoning)

After each subagent:
- Main session reviews finding quality (does severity match impact, are reproduction steps clear, is root cause verified at file:line)
- Updates master findings matrix in this spec
- If finding involves a cross-tab pattern, adds to "Cross-tab patterns" section (so next subagent learns)

### Per-subagent task template

Each subagent gets a self-contained prompt including:
1. The tab name + location references
2. Auth credentials (Nginx basic + admin JWT login — passed via prompt, NOT committed to spec)
3. SSH to `165.227.170.3` with key `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
4. DB access: read-only psql via ssh tunnel (connection string with `default_transaction_read_only=on` session param)
5. The 6-axis checklist
6. Live test URL + how to reach
7. Output file path: `docs/admin-audit/findings/{tab-slug}.md`

**Write gate:** subagents have no direct channel to the user. If a finding genuinely requires a DB WRITE (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/etc.) to reproduce or verify, the subagent must:

1. STOP — do not execute the write
2. Report back to main session with: the exact SQL it wants to execute, why it's necessary, what the rollback looks like if something goes wrong
3. Main session relays this to the user in their next turn
4. User explicitly approves or denies
5. If approved, main session re-dispatches the subagent with explicit permission to run that specific SQL (or runs it inline and shares the result)

Read queries are default and need no approval.

## Logistics

### Auth + access
- **Admin login:** `admin@auracore.pro` account (password in subagent prompt only). Existing account; no test admin creation needed.
- **Nginx basic auth:** `auracore_admin` / <password in subagent prompt>. Required to hit `admin.auracore.pro`.
- **SSH key:** `C:/Users/Admin/.ssh/id_ed25519`. Standing authorization to root@165.227.170.3.
- **Postgres password:** `auracorepro2026` (primary guess; fallback `auracore2026` per user recall).

### Mobile testing
- **Tool:** `mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__*` (Chrome MCP with device emulation).
- **Viewports:** 320 (iPhone SE), 375 (iPhone 14 mini), 414 (iPhone 14 Pro Max), 768 (iPad portrait), 1024 (iPad landscape).
- **Per tab:** subagent loads the tab at 320px first (worst case); finds any overflow / cramped / broken; then verifies at 768px (tablet) and notes whether desktop-to-mobile transition is clean.

### DB access guardrails
- Default: `SET default_transaction_read_only = on;` at session start (Postgres session-level safeguard).
- Any write: subagent STOPS and reports back. User's main-session turn approves or denies. Write command executed only after explicit `yes` in the turn.
- Read queries documented in finding file (reproducibility).

## Baseline known bugs (pre-audit starting list)

These are known before the audit begins. Audit will verify, characterize, and add file:line references. **Do NOT fix**; document only.

| ID | Title | Severity | Axis | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B-1 | Grant Subscription tier sync gap (Users.Tier not updated) | High | code-db-sync | Phase 6.6 spec § "Related future work" |
| B-2 | Refresh button data-loss (cross-tab) | Critical | ux, functional | User report 2026-04-21 brainstorm |
| B-3 | Stale admin panel after mutations (general) | Medium | code-db-sync | Phase 6.6 spec § "Bug 3" |
| B-4 | Rollback artifacts unknown — user recalls breaking panel adding security, rolled back | Unknown | drift | User report 2026-04-21 brainstorm |

## Findings matrix (live — updated as audit progresses)

| Tab | Auditor | Status | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Findings file |

| Subscriptions | - | pending | - | - | - | - | - |
| Users | - | pending | - | - | - | - | - |
| Licenses | - | pending | - | - | - | - | - |

## Cross-tab patterns (live — updated as audit surfaces patterns)

Section filled in by main session as findings accumulate. Expected categories:

- Dual-source-of-truth fields (Bug 2 pattern, possibly >1 tab)
- Stale-after-mutation UI (Bug 3 pattern, possibly >1 tab)
- Missing audit logging (admin action not recorded)
- Inconsistent confirmation dialogs (some destructive actions confirmed, some not)
- Deploy drift (source-vs-live divergence, possibly >1 tab)
- Mobile table overflow pattern (if most tabs break at 320px the same way, one unified fix)

## Non-goals

- No scope creep into fixes. Audit surfaces findings; batch fix phase (6 Item 8) consumes them.
- No new tests added during audit (audit adds findings, not test coverage).
- No refactor suggestions unless they're the only viable fix for a critical/high finding.
- No penetration testing of non-admin endpoints (this audit is scoped to admin panel).

## Success criteria (audit is DONE when)

- All 12 tabs have a completed `docs/admin-audit/findings/{tab}.md` file with at least the 6 axes covered (or "no findings" noted)
- Findings matrix in this spec is fully populated
- Cross-tab patterns section has ≥ 2 patterns documented (or note "no cross-tab patterns found")
- Baseline known bugs (B-1 through B-4) are cross-referenced to specific finding IDs in their tabs
- Main session has reviewed all 12 findings files for completeness, severity calibration, and reproducibility

**Spec end.** Implementation plan next — `writing-plans` skill invocation.
